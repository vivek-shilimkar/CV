          Indonesian Through-flow (ITF) is the only major low-latitude oceanic pathway between two oceans, 
          which transports around 15 Sv of water from the Pacific to Indian Ocean. 
          As water is transported, it affects the physical properties of both the oceans on different time scales. 
          Which in turn affects the climate system of Indian Ocean rim countries. 
          During my PhD I improved the understanding of decadal variability of ITF and 
          devised a new method of estimating the ITF volume transport based on atmospheric wind and surface heating data. 

      - degree: MSc in Atmospheric Science
        university: University of Pune
        time: 2013 - 2015

          Master's Dissertation titled "Variability and trends in tropical Indian Ocean Sea surface salinity in changing climate". 
          Our study examined the variability and trend in tropical Indian Ocean Sea surface salinity (SSS) in changing climate using an observed data and CMIP5 historical simulations. The results indicate the dipole like variation and trend in SSS associated with the precipitation during Indian Ocean Dipole and ENSO events and trend, in boreal summer monsoon period (JJAS).
      - degree: BSc in Physics
        College: S.P. College, Pune
